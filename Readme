Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. You'll work with a publicly available dataset (you can find datasets on platforms like Kaggle) and perform the following tasks:

Extract data from a raw data source.

Transform it (e.g., clean, filter, and aggregate data).

Load the transformed data into a SQL-based database.
